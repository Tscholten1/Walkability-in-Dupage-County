 Map details
Accessing GIS data that is accurate and timely in terms of updates is challenging to come by, however this lesson revealed the significant benefits of using Open Street Map particularly with community-level spatial ananlysis. As the lesson progressed one of the cartographic challenges was balancing proper visual hierachy with a vast amount of data, primarily lines and to a lesser degree, polygons. The challenge was showing enough map features at a scale that would be readable. For this reason, a smaller map is used in this landing page while a much larger scale with more detail and features can be found at the higher resolution link.

Key lessons learned:
<ul>
  <li>Working with Open Street Map to acquire local/regional micro data</li>
<li>Perform geoprocessing (e.g. spatial analysis) using the buffer tool</li>
<li>Using QuickOSM to acquire OSM tags to expedite the data acquisition procress by querying key values of map data</li>
<li>Using QuickOSM Processing Toolbox to remove unnecessary data fields</li>
<li>Refine the symbology process of point, line, and polygon features by exploring the tools and methods in Qgis</li>
<li>Adding multiple ground control points using Add Point feature (found in the Georefencer tool)</li>
<li>Creating vector data layers such as points, lines, and polygons using Qgis tools (Layer>Create Layer)
<li>Using the Select by Location tool to cafes that intersect one mile buffers around each park. Using this tool for this process preserved key attribute information which would have been lost if the clip or intersection tool were used.</li>
<li>Effort was also spent creating the proper visual hierarchy for the maps and ensuring an attractive map product. Coordinate Reference System: NAD83(HARN)/Illinois East (ftUS) EPSG:3443. Basemap: Open Street Map. Other data provided by The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (trail shapefile), Natural Earth (10m graticule).</li>
